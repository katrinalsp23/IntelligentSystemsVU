This bot has basically two mode: (1) playing a card when it is the bot's turn and (2) playing a card when it is the
opponent's turn and a card has been played.

Let's first talk about mode 1. As we get into this mode, we first check if there is a possibility of a trump
exchange. If there is such a possibility, we simply return this move and the work of the bot ends. We then check for
any possibly marriage, and proceed in the same way as trump exchange. If none of the above is true, we try the
strategy that has been implemented by using Knowledge Base. The following is the strategy of the KB:

"Try to play a card of the suit given that all the cards of the same suit having higher value than this card have
already been played.For example, if we have a King of Clubs, we play that card if and only if 10 and Ace of Clubs
have been played."

When this KB is checked for satisfaction, this strategy is not evoked first. Before that, we check if that card is a
trump card, and if this is true, then we don't play that card. Remember, for a card to be played, we have to return
false instead of true as a card would only be played if the model is not satisfiable with negative of that card. We
then check if the card is an Ace, and if it is we play it. This is because the current strategy is not capable of
playing an Ace from any suit. After this, we apply the above mentioned strategy.

If all goes well, the message 'Strategy Applied' is printed on the console. If somehow these tests fail,
we play either the highest possible card or the lowest possible card. Multiple tournaments have shown that both these
strategies have similar results, hence any of these can be used to play a card.

Apart from this, there is check to see if the score of our bot has exceeded a particular threshold. From this point
on we can play with a strong bias towards gaining maximum points in minimum time. So we try to play maximum number of
trump cards onto the table, because they have a higher chance of winning.

Mode 2 is chosen when we have to reply to a card played by the opponent. This is a relatively simple strategy. We
first check if the played card is from the trump suit. If it is from the trump suit, we try to find a trump card with
value higher than the played card. If such a card is not found, we can predict that we loose that trick,
hence we play the lowest possible card. If the played card is not from the trump suit, we first check for a card
stronger than that card, then we look for a trump card to win that trick. If these conditions are not fulfilled,
it can be predicted that we loose that trick, hence we simply play the lowest non-trump card. Again, if we don't have
such a card, we play the lowest possible card.

It loads general information about the game, as well as the definition of a strategy,
from load.py.
